## Core Tenets (NEVER COMPROMISE)

### Clean Break
- No backwards compatibility with old/broken implementations
- If something was done wrong before, delete it and redo it correctly
- Don't add workarounds for legacy behavior

### Future-Proofed Design
- Design for the architecture we want, not the one we have
- Think about how this will scale to full browser parity
- Don't paint ourselves into corners with short-term decisions

### Unlimited Time
- Do it right the first time
- No "fix later" TODOs for core functionality
- Quality over speed - we're building infrastructure

### Overwrite, Don't Preserve
- Delete legacy code, don't work around it
- Rewrite modules that are fundamentally broken
- Don't accumulate workarounds

### Unity ECS
- Do not use EntityManager when yo ucan avoid it. 
- Use Unity ECS Jobs
